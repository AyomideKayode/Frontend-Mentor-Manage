## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned


In building this project, i got to learn the use of hsl color values, creating easy to use css values with on root, using SVGs and also some JavaScript.

```
Some JavaScript code I'm proud of
```
```JS
const primaryHeader = document.querySelector('.primary-header');
const navToggle = document.querySelector(".mobile-nav-toggle");
const primaryNav = document.querySelector(".primary-navigation");
```
```css
:root {
  --clr-accent-400: hsl(12, 88%, 59%);
  --clr-accent-300: hsl(12, 88%, 75%);
  --clr-accent-100: hsl(13, 100%, 96%);

### Continued development

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://a11yslider.js.org/) - This helped me for a slider section in the website. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://svgsprit.es/) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand how icons are properly converted into svgs for easier use in the html. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
